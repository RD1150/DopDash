## Messaging Strategy

### **What to Emphasize in Marketing**

### **What NOT to Emphasize**

- ❌ Comprehensive life management (you're not Lunatask)

- ❌ Complex features (you're simpler than competitors)
- ❌ Habit building alone (you're task-focused, not habit-focused)

---

## Conclusion

**Dopamine Dasher's Positioning:** The **fastest, most celebratory, most ADHD-friendly task app** for breaking overwhelm into instant dopamine wins.

**Your Competitive Advantage:** Instant confetti rewards + ADHD-specific design + zero friction + lifetime pricing
