# Mailchimp Account Recovery Email

**To:** billing@mailchimp.com (or use their support form at https://mailchimp.com/contact/)

**Subject:** Account Recovery Request - Unable to Access Account (Billing Issue)

---

**Email Body:**

Hello Mailchimp Support Team,

I am writing to request help recovering access to my Mailchimp account. I have been paying $20/month for this account but can no longer access it because the email address associated with the account is no longer available to me.

**Account Details:**
- **Billing amount:** $20/month
- **Old email address:** [INSERT YOUR OLD EMAIL HERE]
- **Current email address:** [INSERT YOUR CURRENT EMAIL HERE]
- **Approximate account creation date:** [ESTIMATE IF YOU REMEMBER]

**Proof of Ownership:**
I can provide bank statements or credit card statements showing the recurring $20 monthly charges from Mailchimp to verify my identity and ownership of this account.

**What I Need:**
I would like to either:
1. **Update the email address** on my account to my current email ([INSERT CURRENT EMAIL]) so I can access it, OR
2. **Cancel the account** to stop the recurring $20/month charges

I have been unable to log in or reset my password because the old email address is no longer accessible.

Please let me know what additional information or documentation you need from me to verify my identity and resolve this issue.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR CURRENT EMAIL]
[YOUR PHONE NUMBER - optional but helpful]

## Alternative: Use Mailchimp's Account Recovery Form

If they have a specific form for account recovery, use that instead. Look for:
- "Can't access my account"
- "Billing dispute"
- "Account recovery"

## What to Attach:
- Screenshot of bank statement showing Mailchimp charges
- Any old confirmation emails from Mailchimp (if you have them)

## Expected Timeline:
- Mailchimp support usually responds within 24-48 hours
- Account recovery can take 3-5 business days

## If They Can't Help:
- **Dispute the charges** with your bank/credit card company
- Explain you've been locked out and unable to cancel
- Most banks will stop the recurring charge and potentially refund recent months
