## Email Template

**Send this to:** support@mailchimp.com

**Subject:** Account Recovery Request - Locked Out of Account (Email: [old-email@example.com])

---

**Body:**

```
Hello Mailchimp Support,

I'm writing to request help recovering access to my Mailchimp account 
that I can no longer access.

ACCOUNT DETAILS:
- Associated Email: [your-old-email@example.com]
- Account Created: [approximate date, e.g., "2023"]
- Billing Email: [if different from above]
- Current Email: [your-new-email@example.com]

SITUATION:
I created a Mailchimp account using an email address that I no longer 
have access to. I haven't used the account in [X months/years], but I 
see recurring charges of $20/month on my credit card statement.

I would like to either:
1. Update the email address associated with the account to my current 
   email ([your-new-email@example.com]), OR
2. Cancel the account and stop the recurring charges

VERIFICATION:
To verify I own this account, I can provide:
- The credit card used for billing (last 4 digits: XXXX)
- Billing statements showing the charges
- The approximate date the account was created
- Any other information you need to verify ownership

I've tried using the "Forgot Password" feature, but since I don't have 
access to the old email address, I cannot complete the recovery process.

Please help me regain access to this account or cancel it so I can stop 
the recurring charges.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Phone Number]
[Your Current Email]
```
