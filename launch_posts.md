# Dopamine Dasher Launch Posts

## 1. REDDIT - r/ADHD (Main Launch Post)

**Title:** I built Dopamine Dasher for my ADHD brain and I'm finally sharing it - no login, no guilt, just wins

**Post:**

I have ADHD and I'm tired of task apps that make me feel broken.

Every productivity app I've tried follows the same formula: big lists, overwhelming features, guilt when I don't finish. They're designed for neurotypical brains that can push through resistance. Mine doesn't work that way.

So I built **Dopamine Dasher** - a task app that actually gets how ADHD brains work.

**Here's what makes it different:**

- **Instant gratification** - Complete a task, see the celebration immediately. Your brain gets the dopamine hit it needs.
- **Micro-tasks only** - 2-5 minute wins. No 3-hour projects. Just achievable momentum.
- **Gamified rewards** - Streaks, badges, and visual progress. It feels like playing, not working.
- **Zero friction** - No login. No signup. No explanation walls. Just start.
- **ADHD-designed** - Built by someone with ADHD, for people with ADHD. No judgment. No shame.

**The honest part:** I built this because I was staring at my to-do list for 20 minutes doing nothing. Task paralysis is real. But when I broke things into tiny wins and celebrated each one? Everything changed.

It's live now at **dopaminedasher.com** (completely free to try).

I'm not trying to sell you anything. I just built the app I needed and thought you might need it too.

Try it. Tell me what breaks. Tell me what helps. This is just the beginning.

**Comments to expect/replies to prepare:**
- "How is this different from [other app]?" → Because those apps were built for brains like yours. This was built for brains like mine.
- "Will it have X feature?" → Maybe! What would actually help you?
- "Is there a mobile app?" → Not yet, but the web app works great on mobile.

me: *stares at to-do list for 20 minutes*

also me: *completes one tiny task and feels like I conquered the world*

Built **Dopamine Dasher** because I needed an app that rewards me for actually starting, not for being perfect.

**Post:**

Hey everyone! 👋

I'm sharing something I built because I know so many of you struggle with this: **task paralysis**.

I have ADHD and I was stuck in the cycle - big to-do lists, feeling overwhelmed, doing nothing, feeling guilty. Repeat.

So I built **Dopamine Dasher** - a task app that's actually designed for how ADHD brains work:

✅ **Micro-tasks only** (2-5 minutes)  
✅ **Instant celebration** (dopamine hit when you win)  
✅ **Zero friction** (no login, no signup, just start)  
✅ **Gamified** (streaks, badges, visual progress)  
✅ **No judgment** (built by someone with ADHD, for people with ADHD)

It's completely free to try: **dopaminedasher.com**

I'm not here to sell you - I'm here because I know how much this struggle sucks and I wanted to build something that actually helps.

If you try it, I'd love your feedback. What works? What doesn't? What would actually help you?

Why I built this:

I was staring at my to-do list for 20 minutes doing nothing.

Every task app I tried was designed for neurotypical brains. Big lists. Overwhelming features. Guilt when you don't finish.

My brain doesn't work that way. So I built something that does.

## 7. LINKEDIN - Professional Version

**Post:**

I built Dopamine Dasher because I understand the cost of task paralysis.

As someone with ADHD, I struggled with traditional productivity apps designed for neurotypical workflows. Big lists. Overwhelming features. Guilt-driven motivation.

So I designed something different: a task app that works with ADHD brains, not against them.

**Key features:**
- Micro-task focus (2-5 minute wins)
- Instant gratification and celebration
- Gamified progress tracking
- Zero friction entry (no login required)
- ADHD-centered design principles

**Why this matters:** ADHD affects ~5% of adults and impacts productivity, self-esteem, and mental health. Better tools = better outcomes.

Dopamine Dasher is live and free to try at dopaminedasher.com.

If you know someone who struggles with task initiation or ADHD-related productivity challenges, I'd appreciate you sharing this.

Feedback welcome. 🌱

## What NOT to Do

❌ Don't oversell or make unrealistic claims  
❌ Don't compare directly to other apps (focus on your unique value)  
❌ Don't ignore feedback or criticism  
❌ Don't spam - one post per group/channel  
❌ Don't be salesy - be authentic and vulnerable  

---

## Engagement Strategy

**When people comment/DM:**
- Thank them for trying it
- Ask what worked/what didn't
- Be genuinely interested in feedback
- Offer to help if they get stuck
- Share their wins (with permission)

**Red flags to address:**
- If people say it's confusing → Simplify
- If people want features → Add to roadmap
- If people find bugs → Fix immediately
- If people love it → Ask them to share
