# Dopamine Dasher: Decision Tree Framework
## ADHD-Informed Task Sequencing & Capacity-Aware Productivity

---

## Core Philosophy

**Not:** "Force tasks done through willpower"  
**Yes:** "Optimize for success by matching activities to actual capacity and nervous system state"

This framework acknowledges that **ADHD brains have different activation energy requirements** and that **body regulation directly impacts task completion**.

---

## Research Foundation

### 1. Task Initiation vs. Task Execution
- **ADHD barrier:** Getting *started* (activation energy), not doing the task
- **Implication:** Micro-wins and momentum-building matter more than task duration
- **Strategy:** Low-barrier entry tasks first to build momentum

### 2. Autonomic Nervous System Regulation
- **ADHD reality:** Dysregulated nervous system = impaired executive function
- **Research:** Polyvagal theory shows ADHD brains struggle with nervous system regulation
- **Implication:** Body state (tired, dysregulated, activated) must be assessed before task sequencing
- **Strategy:** Offer regulatory activities (movement, rest, sensory) before demanding tasks

### 3. Movement & Dopamine
- **Research:** Exercise increases dopamine and norepinephrine (neurotransmitters ADHD brains need)
- **Finding:** Strategic movement improves focus, task initiation, and sustained attention
- **Implication:** Some people need movement *before* they can focus
- **Strategy:** Offer movement options for low-energy states

### 4. Rest as Productivity
- **ADHD reality:** Many neurodivergent people don't recognize they're tired until they crash
- **Research:** Strategic rest prevents burnout and improves downstream productivity
- **Implication:** A 20-minute bath might enable 2 hours of productive work later
- **Strategy:** Validate rest as a legitimate productivity tool, not laziness

### 5. Capacity Awareness
- **ADHD barrier:** Poor interoception (body awareness) leads to overcommitment
- **Implication:** People need to explicitly assess available time and energy
- **Strategy:** Start with "How much time do you have?" and "How's your body feeling?"

## Decision Tree: Main Flow

```
START
  ↓
Q1: "How much time do you have today?"
  ├─ 15 minutes
  ├─ 30 minutes
  ├─ 1 hour
  └─ 2+ hours
  ↓
Q2: "What needs doing?" (Brain dump - list everything)
  ↓
Q3: "How's your body/brain feeling?"
  ├─ Squirrel (Overwhelmed, scattered, can't focus)
  ├─ Tired (Low energy, sluggish, need activation)
  ├─ Focused (Good energy, ready to work)
  └─ Hurting (Physical pain, dysregulated, need rest)
  ↓
Q4: "What would help you succeed today?"
  ├─ Rest activity (bath, nap, quiet time)
  ├─ Movement (walk, stretch, dance)
  ├─ Social (body doubling, accountability)
  ├─ Creative (play, doodle, music)
  └─ Grind (focused work)
  ↓
SEQUENCE TASKS based on time + state + selected activity
  ↓
START FIRST TASK
```

## State-Based Task Sequencing

### State 1: SQUIRREL (Overwhelmed, Scattered, Can't Focus)

**Nervous System:** Hyperaroused, scattered attention, decision paralysis  
**Root Issue:** Too many options = activation paralysis  
**Activation Energy Needed:** LOW (2-3 minutes to start)

**Recommended Sequence:**
1. **Micro-activation task** (1-2 min) - Something TINY to build momentum
   - Examples: "Open one piece of mail," "Put on shoes," "Drink water"
   - Goal: Just get moving
2. **Easy win task** (3-5 min) - Still small, but slightly more substantial
   - Examples: "Sort mail into piles," "Make bed," "Tidy one shelf"
   - Goal: Build momentum and confidence
3. **Medium task** (10-15 min) - Now you have momentum
   - Examples: "Address 3-5 mail items," "Organize bedroom," "Do dishes"
   - Goal: Accomplish something meaningful

**Why this works:** ADHD brains need *momentum*, not willpower. Each small win releases dopamine, making the next task easier.

---

### State 2: TIRED (Low Energy, Sluggish, Need Activation)

**Nervous System:** Hypoaroused, low dopamine, sluggish executive function  
**Root Issue:** Body isn't activated enough for focus  
**Activation Energy Needed:** MOVEMENT FIRST (5-10 min)

**Recommended Sequence:**
1. **Activation activity** (5-10 min) - Movement to wake up the nervous system
   - Examples: "Stretch for 5 min," "Walk around the block," "Dance to one song"
   - Goal: Increase heart rate, activate dopamine system
2. **Easy task** (5-10 min) - Capitalize on activation momentum
   - Examples: "Sort mail," "Make coffee and breakfast," "Tidy one room"
   - Goal: Use the activation energy to accomplish something
3. **Medium task** (15-20 min) - Now you have both energy and momentum
   - Examples: "Deep clean bathroom," "Organize paperwork," "Work on project"
   - Goal: Tackle something that requires sustained focus

**Why this works:** Movement increases dopamine and norepinephrine, making executive function accessible. Task initiation becomes possible.

---

### State 3: FOCUSED (Good Energy, Ready to Work)

**Nervous System:** Well-regulated, good dopamine, ready for sustained attention  
**Root Issue:** None—this is optimal state  
**Activation Energy Needed:** MINIMAL (can jump to meaningful work)

**Recommended Sequence:**
1. **Warm-up task** (5 min) - Optional, but helps transition into flow
   - Examples: "Review task list," "Set up workspace," "Do 5-min stretch"
   - Goal: Mental preparation
2. **Primary task** (20-40 min) - Deep work, complex projects, high-focus work
   - Examples: "Address 10+ mail items," "Complete project section," "Strategic planning"
   - Goal: Use this peak state for your most important work
3. **Secondary task** (10-20 min) - If energy remains, tackle another priority
   - Examples: "Organize files," "Respond to emails," "Plan tomorrow"
   - Goal: Maximize the focused state while it lasts

**Why this works:** When ADHD brains are regulated and focused, they can hyperfocus. Protect this state by putting important work here.

---

### State 4: HURTING (Physical Pain, Dysregulated, Need Rest)

**Nervous System:** Dysregulated, in pain, low capacity  
**Root Issue:** Body needs care before productivity  
**Activation Energy Needed:** NONE—REST FIRST

**Recommended Sequence:**
1. **Rest activity** (15-30 min) - Genuine rest, not "productive rest"
   - Examples: "Bath," "Nap," "Lie down with music," "Gentle stretching"
   - Goal: Regulate nervous system, reduce pain, restore capacity
2. **Gentle task** (5-10 min) - Only if energy returns after rest
   - Examples: "Gentle organizing," "Light tidying," "Mindful activity"
   - Goal: Gentle re-engagement, not pushing
3. **Check-in** - Reassess body state
   - If still hurting: More rest
   - If better: Can move to Tired or Focused sequence

**Why this works:** Pushing through pain dysregulates the nervous system further. Strategic rest prevents crashes and enables better productivity later.

- Show full sequence below (so they see the plan)

### During Task: FocusMode
- Display task-specific duration (not hardcoded 15 min)
- Show encouragement messages relevant to their state
- Option to pause and reassess state
- "I need a break" button (not shame-based)

## Key Design Principles

1. **Capacity-First Approach:** Time and energy assessment before task selection
2. **State-Aware Sequencing:** Different sequences for different nervous system states
3. **Momentum-Building:** Small wins first to build dopamine and confidence
4. **No Shame:** Rest is valid, breaks are productive, partial completion is a win
5. **Flexibility:** Ability to reassess and change sequences mid-session
6. **Transparency:** Show the full task sequence so they see the plan
7. **Regulation-Focused:** Nervous system state matters more than task type

---

## Next Steps

1. Validate this framework with ADHD users
2. Design UI screens based on decision tree
3. Implement task sequencing logic in backend
4. Create task templates for each category
5. Build nervous system regulation activity library
6. Test with real users across different states
7. Iterate based on feedback
