🟢 Dopamine Dasher - Task Management for ADHD
We're building the productivity app that ADHD brains actually enjoy using.
Breaking task paralysis into 2-5 minute wins.
```

**First Post:**
```
🧠 The Problem with Most Productivity Apps:
They're designed for neurotypical brains.

If you have ADHD, they make you feel worse, not better. Guilt. Shame. Paralysis.

🟢 We built Dopamine Dasher differently:
✅ Break overwhelming projects into 2-5 minute wins
✅ Instant dopamine rewards (confetti, celebrations)
✅ No judgment. No guilt.
✅ Zero friction (no login, no credit card)

The result? People with ADHD actually get things done.

We're launching soon. Join the waitlist: [link]

**First Email:**
```
Subject: You're not broken. Your task app is. 🟢

Hi there,

If you have ADHD, you've probably felt this:

Staring at your to-do list for 20 minutes.
Feeling paralyzed.
Hating yourself for not getting started.

Then you try a productivity app. It makes you feel worse.

More guilt. More shame. More paralysis.

Here's the truth: You're not broken. Your task app is.

🟢 We built Dopamine Dasher for ADHD brains.

It works like this:
1. Pick a 2-5 minute task (not overwhelming)
2. Complete it
3. BOOM 💥 Confetti. Celebration. Dopamine hit.
4. Momentum builds. You keep going.

No judgment. No guilt. Just wins.

Try it free for 30 seconds. No login. No credit card.

We're launching next week. Early access for subscribers.

P.S. We're ADHD-founded. We get it. 🧠
