## Email Marketing Templates

**Subject:** "You're not broken. Your task app is. 🟢"

```
Hi [First Name],

Welcome to Dopamine Dasher.

You know that feeling? Staring at your to-do list for 20 minutes. Feeling paralyzed. Hating yourself for not getting started.

Then you try a productivity app. It makes you feel worse.

More guilt. More shame. More paralysis.

Here's what we know: You're not broken. Your task app is.

We built Dopamine Dasher for ADHD brains.

It works like this:
1. Pick a 2-5 minute task (not overwhelming)
2. Complete it
3. BOOM 💥 Confetti. Celebration. Dopamine hit.
4. Momentum builds. You keep going.

No judgment. No guilt. Just wins.

[CTA: Try Free - 30 Seconds to Your First Win]

Questions? Reply to this email. We read every one.

P.S. We're ADHD-founded. We get it. 🧠
