# Dopamine Dasher - Launch Announcement Posts

## Reddit - r/ADHD

**Title:** Finally, a task app that doesn't make you feel broken.

**Post:**

Hey ADHD brains! 👋 I just launched **Dopamine Dasher**, and I built it specifically for us.

You know that feeling? Staring at your to-do list for 20 minutes and doing absolutely nothing. The paralysis. The guilt. The shame spiral.

Dopamine Dasher breaks that cycle.

Instead of overwhelming you with a massive to-do list, it turns your projects into **2-5 minute micro-wins**. No judgment. No guilt. Just instant dopamine hits that actually get you moving.

**Why it works:**
- **Time-based difficulty** - Pick 2, 5, or 10 minutes. That's it.
- **Micro-task templates** - 45+ pre-built tasks across 3 contexts (Home, Work, Self)
- **Instant rewards** - Confetti, animations, and celebration effects after every win
- **No friction** - Free to try. No login. No signup. No credit card.

Takes 30 seconds to get your first dopamine hit. Seriously.

**Try it free:** dopaminedasher.com

Would love your feedback! What's the biggest pain point you face with task apps?

The magic? Breaking paralysis into momentum.

Your brain doesn't need a 2-hour project. It needs a 2-minute win. Then another. Then another.

That's how you build momentum without the shame spiral.

**Introducing Dopamine Dasher: The Productivity App Built for ADHD Brains**

I've spent years struggling with task paralysis—staring at my to-do list for 20 minutes, doing nothing, then spiraling into shame.

That's not a personal failing. That's how ADHD brains work.

So I built **Dopamine Dasher** to solve it.

Instead of overwhelming lists, it breaks projects into **2-5 minute micro-wins**. Each completion triggers instant dopamine feedback (confetti, animations, rewards). This builds momentum without the guilt.

**Key Features:**
- Time-based difficulty selection (2/5/10 minutes)
- 45+ pre-built micro-task templates
- Instant reward animations and celebrations
- Smart task suggestions
- Free to try—no login, no credit card required

**Why this matters:** Studies show that ADHD brains respond better to immediate rewards and shorter task cycles. Dopamine Dasher is designed around this neuroscience.

The app is live now at **dopaminedasher.com**. It's free to try, and I'd love your feedback.

If you or someone you know struggles with task paralysis, this one's for you.
