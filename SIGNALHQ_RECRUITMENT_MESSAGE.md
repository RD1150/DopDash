## Email Body

### Version A: Conversational & Energetic

**Subject:** Free Beta: Task App Built FOR ADHD Brains (Not Against Them) 🚀

---

Hey there!

We're launching **Dopamine Dasher**, a task app designed specifically for ADHD brains—and we need YOU to test it.

**Here's the thing:** Most task apps are built for neurotypical brains. They expect you to plan everything, stick to schedules, and push through resistance. That's not how ADHD brains work.

Dopamine Dasher is different. It's built on understanding executive dysfunction, decision fatigue, and the dopamine hits that actually keep you motivated.

**What you get as a beta tester:**

✨ **Free lifetime premium access** (normally $29.99)  
✨ **Pick & Win bonus** – Choose a vibe, unlock an exclusive discount  
✨ **Early-access features** before public launch  
✨ **Your feedback shapes the app** – We actually listen and iterate  
✨ **Recognition** as a founding member in our launch community

**What we need from you:**

- Try the app for 2 weeks (no pressure if you don't love it)
- Complete at least 5 tasks using Brain Check or FocusMode
- Share one piece of feedback (bug report, feature idea, or what worked)
- Tell us if it actually helped you get stuff done

### Version B: Direct & Data-Driven

**Subject:** Beta Testers Needed: ADHD-Focused Task App (Free Premium Access)

---

We're beta testing **Dopamine Dasher**, an ADHD-friendly task management app, and we're recruiting 50 testers.

**The Problem We're Solving:**

Traditional task apps fail for ADHD brains because they:
- Require too much upfront planning (decision fatigue)
- Don't account for energy/focus fluctuations
- Punish context-switching instead of supporting it
- Miss the dopamine hits that keep you motivated

**Our Solution:**

Dopamine Dasher features:
- **Brain Check** – Get task recommendations based on your current nervous system state and available time
- **FocusMode** – 15-minute timer with guilt-free exits and micro-try options
- **Streak Tracking** – Build momentum without shame for breaks
- **Gamified Rewards** – Coins, badges, and Dashie celebrations for every win
- **Mood-Task Correlation** – See how your mood improves with task completion

**Beta Tester Benefits:**

- Lifetime premium access (normally $29.99 one-time)
- Direct input on feature development
- Exclusive "founding member" status
- Early access to new features

**Time Commitment:** 2 weeks, 15 minutes/day

**To Join:** [Sign Up for Beta]

### Version C: Story-Driven & Emotional

**Subject:** "Just start. That's enough." – Join Our ADHD Task App Beta

---

**"I have 47 things to do and I can't even start one."**

That's what our founder said before building Dopamine Dasher.

She's ADHD. She knows what it's like to:
- Stare at a task list and feel paralyzed
- Start three things and finish none
- Feel guilty for context-switching
- Crave the dopamine hit that actually keeps you going

So she built an app that gets it.

**Dopamine Dasher is different because:**

It doesn't judge you for switching tasks. It celebrates you for trying for 2 minutes. It knows that on low-energy days, a 5-minute win is a REAL win. It gives you Dashie, a mascot who believes in you, even when you don't believe in yourself.

**We're looking for 50 beta testers who are ready to:**
- Try something built specifically for ADHD brains
- Give honest feedback
- Be part of a community that gets it

**In return, you get:**
- Lifetime premium access (free forever)
- Your voice in shaping the app
- A tool that actually works for your brain

**Ready to try?** [Sign Up for Beta]

The only thing you have to lose is the guilt.
