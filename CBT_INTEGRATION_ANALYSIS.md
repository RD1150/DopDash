## Key CBT Techniques That Align With Dopamine Dasher

### 1. **Behavioral Activation** ✅ PERFECT FIT

**How to Integrate:**

## Why This Works: The Science

**ADHD Brain + CBT + Dopamine Dasher = Therapeutic Synergy**

1. **ADHD Brains Need Dopamine:** ADHD is characterized by dopamine dysregulation. Dopamine Dasher provides immediate dopamine hits (confetti, streaks, rewards).

2. **CBT Addresses Cognitive Distortions:** ADHD leads to negative thought patterns ("I'm broken," "I can't do anything"). CBT challenges these thoughts.

3. **Behavioral Activation Breaks Avoidance:** The #1 problem for ADHD is task avoidance. Dopamine Dasher's micro-tasks + rewards = behavioral activation in action.

4. **Streaks Build Self-Efficacy:** CBT emphasizes building evidence that you CAN do things. Streaks provide concrete proof of capability.

5. **Mood Tracking Shows Cause-Effect:** Users see the direct link between action (task completion) and outcome (mood improvement), which is core to CBT.
